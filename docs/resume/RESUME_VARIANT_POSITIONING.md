## Notes

- Default variant in the app is `web-dev` (default recruiter-facing web application focus).
- Recruiter one-liner (HR-safe, short format):
  `Ex-Cloud Engineer Intern @ Red Hat. Full-stack + cloud engineer (TypeScript/React, AWS/Kubernetes). Linux/FOSS advocate. CS @ UofT.`
- `sales` and `call-centre` share similar support language but differ in emphasis:
  - `sales`: sales/owner-operator outcomes first.
  - `call-centre`: support workflow and service operations first.

A production-ready developer portfolio built with Next.js 15, featuring a tiled window manager aesthetic inspired by Hyprland/Arch Linux. Showcases MDX-powered blog and projects, Cloudflare CDN integration, Resend contact form and parallax scrolling mobile layout. Deployed on Railway with zero-config Railpack builds.

**Modern tech stack meets terminal aesthetics—designed for developers who appreciate both craft and performance.**

## Why This Repo Stands Out

- It is not a generic portfolio shell. The site ships a Hyprland-inspired desktop UI, a distinct mobile layout, MDX-backed writing, and a resume system with automated PDF generation and layout validation in one repo.
- The repo shows product thinking, not just frontend polish: contact delivery, spam protection, CDN-aware media handling, typed content pipelines, and recruiter-ready resume workflows are all versioned together.
- The build pipeline proves more than “it compiles.” `npm run build` regenerates resume PDFs, and the resume verification scripts enforce page count, whitespace, and font consistency so role-specific resume links do not quietly drift.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack And Why Chosen

- **Next.js 15 + React 19**: one deployable surface for the app shell, API routes, blog, project pages, and resume route without splitting the portfolio into multiple services.
- **TypeScript strict mode**: keeps config, MDX-derived content, and resume data changes from silently drifting.
- **Content Collections + MDX**: stores blog and project content in tracked files with build-time validation instead of a separate CMS.
- **Tailwind CSS v4 + modular CSS + Framer Motion**: mixes fast utility styling with deliberately scoped stylesheet modules and animation control for the window-manager aesthetic.
- **Resend + Zod**: gives the contact flow production email delivery plus schema-validated input handling.
- **Local resume PDF tooling**: the repo generates and validates 13 resume variants with local Computer Modern fonts, layout baselines, and deterministic PDF checks.
- **Optional Cloudflare R2**: keeps the project deployable without CDN setup while still supporting a faster production media path.

## ✨ Features

- **Desktop Layout**: 6-tile Hyprland-inspired layout (Neofetch, Navigation, Content, Theme Preset, Accent Color, Background)
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Vim-style hjkl movement + Tab cycling + workspace indicators via Polybar
- **Mobile Experience**: Parallax scrolling with depth effects and scroll progress indicators
- **Theme System**: 3 curated presets (Tokyo Night, Nord, Solarized Light) + 15 accent color swatches
- **Content Management**: MDX-powered blog and projects with syntax highlighting and reading time
- **Audio Narration**: Blog post audio with auto-detection, playback controls, and analytics tracking
- **Contact Form**: Production-ready Resend integration with 5-layer spam protection (honeypot, rate limiting, validation)
- **CDN Integration**: Optional Cloudflare R2 for optimized image delivery with automatic fallback
- **Modern Architecture**: Next.js 15.5 + TypeScript strict mode + modular CSS (12 focused modules under 200 LOC each)
- **Zero-Config Deployment**: Railway + Railpack auto-detection with intelligent caching

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
node >= 18.0.0
npm >= 9.0.0
```

### Setup

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/kmokdefi/kmok-portfolio.git
cd kmok-portfolio
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your RESEND_API_KEY and NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTACT_EMAIL

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

Visit **http://localhost:3000**

### Build Commands

```bash
npm run build      # Production build
npm run start      # Start production server
npm run typecheck  # TypeScript validation
npm run lint       # Code linting
```

These top-level npm entrypoints are normally run exactly as shown here; the repo does not rely on extra README-level flags for day-to-day use.

### Resume PDF Workflow

`npm run build` also regenerates resume PDFs in `public/resume/`.
Resume PDF rendering uses local Computer Modern assets in `public/fonts/cmu/` for deterministic layout metrics.

```bash
npm run measure:resume-layout   # Measure bottom whitespace for all generated resume PDFs
npm run calibrate:resume-layout # Auto-tune per-variant print settings toward legacy baseline
npm run verify:resume-layout    # Enforce legacy baseline bottom whitespace lock
npm run validate-resume-pdfs    # Full gate: page count, page size, fonts, bold, layout baseline
```

Layout rules and baseline source are documented in `docs/resume/resume-generation-spec.md`.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create `.env.local` from template and configure:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | ✅ Yes | Resend API key ([resend.com](https://resend.com) - free: 100 emails/day, 3K/month) |
| `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` | ✅ Yes | Verified domain email for Resend (e.g., `contact@kmok.ai`) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTACT_EMAIL` | ✅ Yes | Email address to receive form submissions |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CDN_URL` | Optional | Cloudflare R2 CDN URL (e.g., `https://cdn.kmok.ai`) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_NAME` | Recommended | Your full name |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_TITLE` | Recommended | Your professional title |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SEO_TITLE` | Recommended | Site or homepage SEO title |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SEO_DESCRIPTION` | Recommended | Site or homepage SEO description |

See [.env.example](.env.example) for the complete environment variable list.

Homepage lead copy is versioned in `config/portfolio.config.ts`, so production deploys can pick it up from git without needing an untracked env override.

### CDN Configuration (Optional)

This project supports **Cloudflare R2** for image hosting:

**Without CDN** (default):
- Images served from `/public/images/`
- Works out-of-the-box, no setup required

**With CDN** (recommended for production):
- Images served from Cloudflare R2
- Faster load times, reduced server bandwidth
- See [CLAUDE.md - Image Storage](CLAUDE.md#image-storage-cdn-configuration) for setup guide

**Quick Setup:**
1. Create Cloudflare R2 bucket
2. Upload images maintaining `/images/` folder structure
3. Connect custom domain (e.g., `cdn.kmok.ai`)
4. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_CDN_URL` in environment variables
5. Deploy - images automatically load from CDN!

### Content Customization

Edit `config/portfolio.config.ts` to customize:
- Personal information and bio
- Project portfolio with metrics
- Skills and technologies
- Blog posts
- ASCII art and system info

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for detailed architecture documentation.

## Resume-ready points by variant

### `ai-web-dev`
- **Built a hybrid recruiter-facing resume** that combines **Next.js web delivery** with an **agentic engineering** story, making `/resume` lead with the strongest current full-stack narrative by default.
- **Added a visible summary block** for the default resume variant, so recruiters immediately see the stack and the **4 concurrent AI workflow** angle before scanning project bullets.
- **Separated AI/devtools work into a dedicated `Agentic Engineering` section**, keeping **web projects** and **agentic systems** distinct without losing one-page fit.
- **Kept homepage and PDF entry points in sync** by deriving the CTA PDF link from the default variant instead of hard-coding an older web-only file.
- **Auto-generated and validated 13 resume variants** and **kept role-specific links consistent**, so resume content stayed accurate whenever project details changed.

### `web-dev`
- **Designed a portfolio experience** with a **6-panel desktop layout** and smooth mobile flow, so hiring managers could scan skills, projects, and resume links quickly without getting lost in navigation.
- **Added 3 themes** and **15 accent colors** to keep content readable across preferences, improving first impressions for recruiters and reducing friction for returning visitors.
- **Set up 5 spam checks** on the contact form and **cut low-quality submissions**, so real recruiter outreach was easier to identify and respond to quickly.
- **Split styles into 12 small CSS modules** (under **200 lines each**), making edits safer and reducing accidental UI regressions during rapid updates.
